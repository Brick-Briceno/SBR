# Modal Harmony

## Introduction
Modal harmony is a system of harmony that is based on modes rather than traditional major and minor scales. This approach allows for a broader palette of sounds and emotional expressions in music composition.

## Understanding Modes
Modes are derived from the major scale and can be thought of as different "flavors" of the scale. Each mode has its own unique characteristics and emotional qualities. The seven modes are:

1. **Ionian** (Major)
2. **Dorian**
3. **Phrygian**
4. **Lydian**
5. **Mixolydian**
6. **Aeolian** (Natural Minor)
7. **Locrian**

## Characteristics of Modal Harmony
- **Tonal Center**: Each mode has a tonal center, which is the note that feels like "home." This note is the root of the mode.
- **Intervals**: The intervals between the notes in each mode create distinct sounds and feelings. For example, the Lydian mode has a raised fourth, giving it a dreamy quality.
- **Chords**: Chords built on the notes of each mode can create unique harmonic progressions. Understanding how to construct chords from each mode is essential for modal harmony.

## Applications in Composition
- **Modal Interchange**: Composers often borrow chords from parallel modes to add color and variety to their progressions.
- **Improvisation**: Musicians can use modes as a basis for improvisation, allowing them to explore different sounds and emotions.
- **Film Scoring**: Modal harmony is frequently used in film music to evoke specific moods and atmospheres.

## Conclusion
Modal harmony offers a rich and diverse approach to music composition. By understanding and utilizing modes, composers can expand their harmonic vocabulary and create more expressive music.
