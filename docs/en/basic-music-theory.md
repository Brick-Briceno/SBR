# Basic Music Theory

## Introduction
Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. It provides a framework for understanding the language of music, including its structure, notation, and the relationships between different musical elements.

## Musical Notation
Musical notation is a system used to visually represent music through the use of symbols. The most common form of notation is the staff, which consists of five lines and four spaces. Notes are placed on the staff to indicate pitch and rhythm.

### Notes and Rests
- **Notes** represent sounds and are indicated by oval shapes. The position of the note on the staff determines its pitch.
- **Rests** indicate silence and are represented by different symbols corresponding to the duration of the silence.

## Scales
A scale is a sequence of notes in ascending or descending order. The most common scales are:

- **Major Scale**: A seven-note scale with a specific pattern of whole and half steps (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).
- **Minor Scale**: Also a seven-note scale, but with a different pattern (W-H-W-W-H-W-W).

## Intervals
An interval is the distance between two pitches. Intervals are named based on the number of letter names they encompass:

- **Unison**: Same pitch
- **Second**: Two letter names apart
- **Third**: Three letter names apart
- **Fourth**: Four letter names apart
- **Fifth**: Five letter names apart
- **Sixth**: Six letter names apart
- **Seventh**: Seven letter names apart
- **Octave**: Eight letter names apart

## Chords
A chord is a combination of three or more notes played simultaneously. The most common types of chords are:

- **Major Chord**: Consists of a root, major third, and perfect fifth.
- **Minor Chord**: Consists of a root, minor third, and perfect fifth.
- **Diminished Chord**: Consists of a root, minor third, and diminished fifth.
- **Augmented Chord**: Consists of a root, major third, and augmented fifth.

## Rhythm
Rhythm refers to the timing of music, including the duration of notes and rests. It is often organized into measures, which are separated by bar lines.

### Time Signatures
A time signature indicates how many beats are in each measure and what note value is equivalent to one beat. Common time signatures include:

- **4/4**: Four beats per measure, quarter note gets one beat.
- **3/4**: Three beats per measure, quarter note gets one beat.
- **6/8**: Six beats per measure, eighth note gets one beat.

## Conclusion
Understanding basic music theory is essential for musicians and composers. It provides the tools needed to analyze, create, and perform music effectively.
