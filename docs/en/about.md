# About SBR

SBR (Symmetry, Brick, Rhythm values) or Brick Symmetry Rhythm, is an interpreted music programming language. Initially focused solely on rhythm and polyrhythms in 2022, it expanded to include melodies as well by the end of 2024. It was designed for experimental musicians who wanted to experiment more, but ultimately, its creator (me) embraced all areas of music where this can help.

So, while it was designed for more advanced and experimental musical composition, it can also be used by music beginners and even teach you music.

From making weird, catchy, good, different, and exciting music (one of its main goals) to helping music theory teachers at conservatories create quick and fun exercises, as it also generates scores, even helping you compose and inspire you. It also exports MIDI files in case you want to apply a professional production.

You can create rhythm bases that you can export to audio for sampling and editing. You can even export just the vocal audio track so the singer knows their part. Even if the singer is in tune but doesn't keep the beat, you can export just the rhythmic part of the melody.

SBR forces you to make good music, in the sense that it's what your environment prompts you to do. You drink more water if the bottle is nearby. If your friends are progressing, they encourage you to progress too.

SBR helps you scale the song by adding the elements it needs. With fewer clicks and fewer keys, you do what you would do in any DAW, not to mention composing on paper.

In fact, it could even help with microtonal music in the future, and I think it could be considered a new branch of music theory, especially focused on rhythm. I think there's a lot of music theory when we talk about tones, talking about the vertical dimension, but little about the horizontal dimension, talking about rhythm.

SBR can generate an infinite number of rhythms that are pleasing to the ear, based on effects that I've personally observed. It's been in the most listened to music of recent years in popular music, and that Some papers from this millennium have found expression in the traditional music of many cultures, which for some reason, perhaps because of its Euclidean symmetry, have prevailed for millennia.

One of its virtues is its documentation. You can find composition techniques, harmony tutorials, and simplified and advanced music theory, and of course, everything about the syntax, effects, generators, commands, operators, and data types available.

SBR borrows concepts from object-oriented programming, which is based on recycling and modifying melodies with techniques that can't even be counted on the toes. We have the philosophy of polymorphism, where one thing can be recycled to have multiple uses in a song or act differently depending on the context.
